## Overview

![screenshot](./preview.png)

Welcome to my Image Uploader project! In this challenge, I've created an image uploading system using React and Express technologies. I invite you to check out the [live demo here](https://{your-site.com}), where you can experience how the image uploader works.

I must confess, this was my first time developing an application that allows drag and drop functionality for images, and I have to say that the process was exhilarating. Discovering how drag and drop events function and interact with the user interface was a journey full of learning and discoveries.

To tackle this challenge, I decided to create a dedicated API that handles the management and storage of user-uploaded images exclusively. This choice allowed me to delve further into the world of server-side programming and storage operations. Furthermore, I have plans to implement additional features, such as connecting to a database, to allow users access to their images even after some time.

I admit that initially, my code wasn't as organized as I would have liked. However, as I progressed in development, I realized the importance of a well-structured codebase. I'm always open to suggestions and constructive criticism to further enhance the structure and efficiency of my project. If you have any ideas on how I could optimize it further, I'd be thrilled to hear from you and continue refining this application.

I hope you enjoy exploring the image uploader as much as I enjoyed creating it! If you have any comments, suggestions, or just want to share your thoughts, feel free to get in touch!

Thank you for visiting my project!
